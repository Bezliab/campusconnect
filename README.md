## Test Data Used

- **Events:**  
  Sample events are provided in `src/data/events.json` with fields such as `id`, `name`, `date`, `time`, `venue`, `category`, `description`, and `image`.
- **Contacts:**  
  Faculty and student coordinators are listed in `src/data/contacts.json` with fields like `id`, `name`, `designation`/`role`, `department`, `phone`, `email`, and `image`.
- **Images:**  
  Placeholder images are used for events and contacts where actual images are not provided.
